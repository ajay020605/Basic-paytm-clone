This is my learning phase project in which i have created a very basic application clone of paytm from which i have learnt authorization using jwt tokens , hashing of password to store in DB there by authentication using bcrypt 
The techstack i have learned here is MERN.
I had used express for server , React and tailwind in front end,
Backend in node.js runtime with database mongoDB using mongoose library
The difficult bit here i learned was initializing a transaction and fully complete it so there is 
no Data inconsistencies.
Hence , i have learned transaction between databases
